ðŸ¦¢ Solutions for Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ ðŸ¦¢
==================================================================

My solutions for the exercises of the 2nd edition of Bjarne Stroustrup & Pete
Petersen's famous textbook, as I go through the chapters. Hope they can be
useful to others, have fun with the book!

**Disclaimer:** *this is the product of self-study. These solutions have not
been reviewed or corrected, and therefore I give no guarantee that they are
correct (although I do believe they are!).*

If an exercise is missing, I simply haven't done it yet!
